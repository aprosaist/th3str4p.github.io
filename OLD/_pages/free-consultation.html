<iframe src="https://calendly.com/th3str4p/free-consultation" width="100%" height="950" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<h3>What happens when I schedule my free consultation?</h3>
<p>You'll receive a calendar invitation from me in your inbox.</p>

<h3>What happens during my free consultation?</h3>
<p>We'll leave no stone unturned as we go over your needs and questions.  Afterwards, we'll go over some definite next steps that we can take to get started.</p>

<h3>What happens after my free consultation?</h3>
<p>Three things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You'll receive a formal proposal from me in your inbox.</li>
  <li>Once you accept the proposal, you'll receive a contract from me in your inbox.</li>
  <li>Once you sign the contract, I'll get started on your project.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What's it like to work with me?</h3>
<p>You'll notice that I do things a little differently.  I call it <i>Different In A Good Way &trade;</i>.</p>
<p>You can expect:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Honesty.</b>  My goal is to build long-term relationships, not to hide the truth for a quick dollar.</li>
  <li><b>Transparency.</b>  My goal is to make sure you always know if things are on schedule.</li>
  <li><b>Simplicity.</b>  My goal is to explain complex concepts in simple language.</li>
</ol>

  <figcaption><b>Honesty.</b>  If I don't think I can help you, I'll tell you.  If something can't reasonably be done, I'll tell you.  My goal is to build long-term relationships, not to hide the truth for a quick dollar.</figcaption>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/transparency.jpg" alt="Transparency">
  <figcaption><b>Transparency.</b>  I'll keep you updated on the status of your projects.  You'll always know if things are behind schedule, on schedule or ahead of schedule.</figcaption>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/simplicity.jpg" alt="Simplicity">
  <figcaption><b>Simplicity.</b>  You have better things to do than learn how the sausage is made.  I'll explain complex concepts in simple language, make sure you're comfortable with everything and then let you get on with your day while I work behind the scenes.</figcaption>
