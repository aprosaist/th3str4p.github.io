Wes Bos is a fullstack web developer from Canada who publishes several online courses to help people like me learn to be better web designers and developers.  JavaScript30 is one of his courses which focuses on building one project per day over a 30-day period with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project is a simple image gallery that responsively resizes as you click on the five different panels.
