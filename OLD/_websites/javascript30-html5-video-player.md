Wes Bos is a fullstack web developer from Canada who publishes several online courses to help people like me learn to be better web designers and developers.  JavaScript30 is one of his courses which focuses on building one project per day over a 30-day period with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project is a simple video player that allows you to adjust the volume and playback speed.  It also allows you to quickly scrub back and forth through the video and includes a quick 10-second rewind button and a quick 25-second fast forward button.
