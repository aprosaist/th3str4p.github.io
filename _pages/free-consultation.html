<h3>What happens after I schedule a free consultation?</h3>
<p>Three things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You'll receive a calendar invitation in your inbox.</li>
  <li>You'll receive an email from me with a link to an optional survey you can fill out to help us make the most of our time together.</li>
  <li>You'll receive a reminder email from me one day prior to our consultation.</li>
</ol>

<h4>What happens during my free consultation?</h4>
<p>Excellent question!  During your free consultation, we'll go over your needs and questions, being sure to leave no stone unturned.  Afterwards, we'll go over some definite next steps that we can take to get started.</p>

<h5>What's it like to work with me?</h5>
<p>After our consultation, if you choose to work with me, you'll notice that I do things a little differently.  I call it <i>Different In A Good Way &trade;</i>.</p>

<p>Here are three things you can expect:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Honesty.</b>  If I don't think I can help you, I'll tell you. If something can't reasonably be done, I'll tell you. My goal is to build long-term relationships, not to hide the truth for a quick dollar.</li>
  <li><b>Transparency.</b>  I'll keep you updated on the status of your projects. You'll always know if things are behind schedule, on schedule or ahead of schedule.</li>
  <li><b>Simplicity.</b>  You have better things to do than learn how the sausage is made. I'll explain complex concepts in simple language, make sure you're comfortable with everything and then let you get on with your day while I work behind the scenes.</li>
</ol>

<p><b><i>Ready to get started?</i></b></p>
