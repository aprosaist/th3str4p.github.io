# The Best Websites for Small Businesses

If you're a small business owner, picking the right platform to host your website on is confusing.  You've probably seen or heard advertisements for services like [**Wix**](https://www.wix.com/) or [**Squarespace**](https://www.squarespace.com/).  You might've talked to other small business owners who have made do with basic tools like [**GoDaddy Website Builder**](https://www.godaddy.com/websites/website-builder).  Perhaps you've talked to a web designer who recommended building a website for you with [**WordPress**](https://wordpress.org/).  Maybe you haven't done any research at all and just want to understand the landscape and get a solid recommendation for which way to go.

In my experience, nearly all small business websites today are built with **WordPress**.  While I haven't conducted a scientific analysis of why this is, I can make some assumptions that are pretty accurate.  WordPress has great brand recognition nowadays, and every web designer is familiar with it to some degree.  It's relatively easy to use and has a ton of available themes and extensions.  This means you can create websites with WordPress for things as far ranging as nonprofit information websites to photographer portfolio websites to full-blown ecommerce stores.  You can even use WordPress to run an online forum or a small social network.

So far it all sounds pretty good, right?

While I'm certainly not bashing WordPress or saying that it *shouldn't* be used, it does have its fair share of drawbacks.  These boil down to three things:  **speed**, **security** and **simplicity**.  Because WordPress itself utilizes a backend database, there is a certain amount of overhead that affects how fast pages load.  There is also a certain amount of complexity to its code which makes for a larger attack surface for hackers to target.  Adding extensions adds to the problem.  All of these things can be mitigated, of course.  There are high-performance web hosting companies you can use to improve page load speed, CDNs that you can use to improve loading speed even more and security extensions that can help keep your WordPress site safe.

Here's what I've observed:
1.  The web designers that small businesses hire are often lacking experience in the optimal way to set up WordPress (including what hosting to use, what CDN to use, what extensions to avoid, etc.).  Please note that I'm not saying this applies to *all* web designers out there.  There are some awesome ones, some terrible ones and a whole bunch of mediocre ones, just like with any profession.
2.  Many small businesses opt not to retain the services of the web designer who builds their WordPress site.  This means that things like security updates inevitably fall by the wayside as the site sits with no real maintenance for extended periods of time.
3.  A lot of small businesses never update their WordPress site on their own.  Oftentimes this is due to a lack of time or a lack of training.  Either way, it means that one of the biggest advertised benefits of WordPress (that it is easy to add content without knowing how to code) goes unutilized or underutilized.

There is a better way.

The vast majority of small business websites are basic "brochure" sites.  They contain some information on the history of the company, the services it offers, contact information and so on.  They may contain a blog, but it is likely rarely updated.  There isn't necessarily anything wrong with this.  In fact, I would venture to say that most small businesses only really need a "brochure" site, albeit one that is optimized for lead generation.  That's a subject for a future post, though.  The fact is, these sites basically stay the same for long periods of time, possibly even years at a time.

There's been a resurgence in the web design and development community of static sites.  The biggest difference between these types of sites and WordPress is that they don't utilize a backend database.  This means that the three primary weaknesses of WordPress (**speed**, **security** and **simplicity**) become the three primary strengths of static sites.  They will consistently load faster that a comparable WordPress site, their security is far stronger and they are comparatively simple and easy to maintain.  In other words, they are perfect for the average small business website.

In business terms, you'll experience three benefits if you choose to use a static site instead of a WordPress site:
1.  **Performance**.  Your site will start out fast and will stay fast.
2.  **Price**.  You can get away with not needing to retain the services of a web designer to make sure your site has the latest security updates each month.  Some hosting for static sites (such as [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/)) is also completely free, saving you money on monthly hosting costs.
3.  **Peace of mind**.  Static sites are virtually impervious to being hacked.  This means you can rest easy knowing that your business' website won't suddenly start serving up malicious code, which hurts your search ranking and your reputation.

To recap, most small businesses websites today are built on WordPress.  It's well known, well supported and powerful.  For some use cases, it's the perfect tool for the job.  But for most small businesses, a static site will be faster, more secure and cheaper in the long run.
