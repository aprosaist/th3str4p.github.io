Wes Bos is a fullstack web developer from Canada who publishes several online courses to help people like me learn to be better web designers and developers.  JavaScript30 is one of his courses which focuses on building one project per day over a 30-day period with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project is a simple set of checkboxes that allows you to click on one at a time or hold shift and click to check multiple boxes at once.
