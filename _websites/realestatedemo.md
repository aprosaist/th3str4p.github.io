This site is a one-page demo for real estate.  The layout is perfect for an individual agent looking for a clean, minimal and responsive site to showcase their credentials, expertise and contact information.  It features an image of the agent with a brief introduction, a highlight section for their credentials and another highlight section for their expertise.  It also features an embedded Zillow search widget which is a stand-in for an embedded MLS search widget.  Finally, there is a section for the agent's contact information along with a contact form to allow site visitors to contact the agent.

Of note, if you view the demo on a mobile device the Zillow widget is not responsive and will look off visually.  This is a limitation of their widget.
