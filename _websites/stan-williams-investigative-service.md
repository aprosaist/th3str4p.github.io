Stan is a private investigator based in Phoenix who hired me to modernize and optimize his site.  This was one of the earlier sites that I built.  I didn't have as much knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript as I do now.  Therefore, I used WordPress along with the Divi theme and builder to construct the new site.  I re-used some of the existing graphics and copy from the old site, but I also spiced it up with some new copy aimed at boosting conversions.

The site has most of what you would expect from a basic "brochure" site.  It includes information on Stan, his services and his expertise.  It also includes a sticky header that scrolls with the page, eye-catching buttons designed to boost conversions and a simple contact form that sends Stan an email when it's submitted.  It's fully responsive and works great on mobile devices as well as desktops.
