<h1>Hi, I'm Ben!</h1>
<p>You could use a lot of words to describe me - Christian, husband, coffee addict - but the best would be student.  In all aspects of my life, <b>I've never stopped learning</b>.</p>
<p><b>I do my best to live by the so-called Golden Rule</b>:  "You must love your neighbor as yourself."</p>
<p>A wise man once said, "But when I reflected on all the works that my own hands had done and on all the hard work that I had toiled to accomplish, I saw that everything was futile, a chasing after the wind; there was nothing of real value under the sun."  In other words, there's more to life than work.  I firmly believe that, which is why <b>I try to offer lasting value to my family, friends and colleagues</b>.</p>
<p><b>I offer web design, graphic design and digital marketing services</b>.  Some clients prefer to work with me on an ongoing basis, while others call me in when they need a little extra help.  Either way, <b>you'll find that working with me is different - in a good way</b>.</p>
