<h1>Hi, I'm Ben!</h1>
<p>You could use a lot of words to describe me - Christian, husband, coffee addict - but in my opinion the best word to use would be student.  In all aspects of my life, I've never stopped learning.</p>
<p>I do my best to live by the so-called Golden Rule:  <q>"You must love your neighbor as yourself."</q>
<p>A wise man once said, <q>"But when I reflected on all the works that my own hands had done and on all the hard work that I had toiled to accomplish, I saw that everything was futile, a chasing after the wind; there was nothing of real value under the sun."</q>  In other words, there's more to life than work.  I wholeheartedly believe that, which is why I try to offer lasting value to my family, friends and colleagues.</p>
